            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>THe ſecond manner to graffe, is ſtrange enough unto many: This kind of Graffing is on the tops of branches of Trees, which thing to make them grow lightly, is not ſo ſoone obtained: certaine it is, that whereſoever they be graffed, they doe onely require a faire young wood, as alſo a great Cion or twig, growing higheſt on the top of the Tree, which Cions ye ſhall chooſe to graffe on of many ſorts of Fruits, if ye will, or as ye ſhall think good, which order followeth.</p>

But if the Cions that ye cut be as big as your graffe you graffe on, ye ſhall cut them lower betwixt the old wood and the new, or a little higher or lower: then cleave a little, and chooſe your graffes in like ſort which you would plant, whereof you ſhall make your inciſion ſhort, with the barke on both ſides alike, and to be as thick on the one ſide as it is on the other, and alſo ſet ſo juſt in cleft, that the bark may be even and cloſe, aſwel above as beneath, on the one ſide as the other, and ſo bind them as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118810:25"/> It ſhall ſuffice that every graft have an oylet or eye, or two at the moſt without the joynt, for to leave them too long it ſhall not be good, and ye muſt dreſſe it with Clay and Moſſe, and bind as it is aforeſaid. And likewiſe ye may graffe theſe, as ye doe little wild Stocks, which ſhould be as big as your graffes, and to graffe them, as you doe thoſe with ſap like on both ſides, but then you muſt graffe them in the, earth, three fingers of, or thereabouts.</p>

For a good Tree planted or ſet well at large, it profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ofttimes more of fruit than three or four Trees ſet too nigh together. The greateſt and largeſt Trees commonly are Wallnuts and Cheſnuts, if ye plant them ſeverally in ranks, as they do commonly grow upon high-ways, beſides hedges and fields, ſet them xxxv foot aſunder, one from another or thereabout, but if ye will plant many ranks in one place together, ye muſt ſet them the ſpace of xlv foot one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or thereabout, and ſo far you muſt ſet your ranks one from another. For the Pear-trees and Apple-trees, and of other ſort of Trees, which may be ſet of this largeneſſe one from the other, if ye plant onely in ranks by hedges in the fields or otherwiſe, it ſhall be ſufficient of xx foot from one another. But if you will ſet two ranks upon the ſides of your great allies in gardens, which be ten or twelve foot broad, it ſhall be then beſt to give them more ſpace, the one from the other in each rank, as about xxv foot, alſo ye muſt not ſet your Trees right one againſt another, but entermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or between every ſpace, as they may beſt grow at large, that if need be, ye mae plant other ſmall Trees between, but ſee that ye ſet them not to thick.

                        <p>ALſo ſuch Cions or Graffs, which you get on other trees, the young Trees of three, four, five or ſix years growth are beſt to take graffs. Take them of no under boughs, but in the top on the Eaſt ſide, if ye can, and the faireſt and greateſt. Ye ſhall cut them two inches long of the old wood beneath the joynt. And when you graff, cut them taper-wiſe from the joynt two inches or more of length, which ſet into the ſtock, and before you ſet it in, open your ſtock with a wedg of Iron or hard wood ſoftly; then if the ſides of your clefts be rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, pare them on both ſides with the point of a ſharp knife within and above, then ſet in your graffes cloſe on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and alſo above, but let your ſtock be as little while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen as ye can, and when your graffs be well ſet in, pluck out your wedge, and if your ſtocks do pinch your graffs much, then ye muſt put in a wedge of the ſame wood to help your graffs: then lay a thick bark or peel over the cleft from the one graff to the other, to keep out the clay and rain, and clay them two fingers thick round about the clefts, then lay on moſſe, but wool is better next your clay, or temper your clay with wool or hair, for it will abide cloſer and ſtronger on the ſtock head, ſome take wool next the clay, and wrap it all over with linnen cloths, for the wool being once moiſt will keep the clay ſo a long time. Others take woollen clouts, that have been laid in the juyce of Worm-wood or ſuch like bitter thing, to keep creeping worms from coming under to the graffs. If ye graff or plant in the Winter, put your clay uppermoſt, for Summer your Moſſe. For in Winter the Moſſe is warme, and your clay will not cleave. In Summer
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118810:40"/> your clay is cold, and your Moſſe keeps him from cleaving or chapping. To bind them take Willow peels, cloven B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118810:51"/> muſt ye dig and cleanſe the ground of weeds, and mix it well with good mold and fat earth. Then divide your Hills a yard one from another orderly, in making them a yard aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and two foot and a half broad in the bottome, and when ye plant them, lay in every Hill three or four Roots: Some do in ſetting of them lay them croſſe-wiſe in the midſt of the Hill, and ſo cover them again: Some ſet the Roots in four parts of the Hill, others likewiſe do make holes round about the Hills, and put of the Roots therein, and ſo cover them again light with earth: of one ſhort root in a year ye may have many Plants, to ſet and lay as ye ſhall ſee it good, and it ſhall be ſufficient for every Plant to have two knots within the ground, and one without, then ſome do chop a Spade croſſe into the Hill, and lay Hop in croſſe, and ſo cover it.</p>

Therefore ſuch as are minded to beſtow labour on the Ground, may have as good Hop growing in this Countrey, as in other Countreys: but if ye will not go to that coſt to make Hop-yards, ye may with a light charge have Hops grow in your Hedge-rows, to ſerve as well as the other, and ſhall be as good for the quantity as the other in all reſpects: ye may (for lack of ground plant Hop roots in hedge-rows, when you do quick-ſet, ſet up poles by them, when time ſhall require in the Spring, and beſtow every Winter after the gathering your Hop, on every hill head a ſhovel-full of Dung to comfort the earth, for then they will bear the more plenty of Hops the next year following.

Otherwiſe the Hops will grow from one pole to another, and ſo overſhadow your Garden, the fault thereof being eſpecially to be imputed to the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the hills. Therefore chiefly you muſt meaſure your poles by the goodneſſe of your ground.</p>
                        <p>Your Hop never ſtocketh kindly, untill it reach higher than the Pole, and return from it a yard or two, for whilſt it tendeth climbing upward, the branches, which grow out of the principal ſtalk (wherein conſiſteth the abundance of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe) grow little or nothing.</p>
                        <p>Let the quantity of your Poles be great (that is to ſay) nine or ten inches about the lower end, ſo ſhall they endure the longer, and withſtand wind the better.</p>
                        <p>To deſcribe the price of poles, or what it will coſt you to furniſh a Garden containing an acre of ground, it were a hard matter, becauſe the place altereth the price of Wood. But in a Wain you may carry an hundred and fifty poles, and I ſee ſmall cauſe why a load of theſe ſhould be much dearer than a load of any other Wood.</p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:118810:60"/>
                        <p>After the firſt year Poles will be nothing chargeable unto you, for you may either pick them out of your own provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Fuell, or buy them of your Neighbours that have no occaſion to apply them this way. For the yearly ſupply of two loads of Poles, will maintain one Acre continually.</p>
                        <p>Your rotten and broken Poles will do you good ſervice, for the kindling of your fires in the Oſte, whereupon you ſhould dry your Hops, and they ſhould be preſerved chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that purpoſe.</p>

                        <p>Before you ſet up your Poles, lay them all alongſt your Garden between every row of hills by three or four toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I mean beſide every hill ſo many Poles as you deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to ſet thereon, ſo ſhall you make the more ſpeed in your work.</p>

Then pare the Plat ſmall, levell it, throw water on it, tread it, and ſweep it, ſo ſhall it be a fair Floore, whereon the Hops muſt lye to be picked.</p>
                        <p>Then beginning near unto the ſame, cut the ſtalks aſunder, cloſe by the tops of the hills, and if the Hops of one Pole be grown faſt unto another, cut them alſo aſunder with a ſharp Hook, and with a forked ſtaffe take them from the Poles.</p>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:118810:65"/>
                        <p>You may make the Fork and Hook (which cutteth aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Hops that grow together) one apt inſtrument to ſerve both theſe turns.</p>
                        <p>Then may you with your forked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>For the better doing hereof, it is very neceſſary that your poles be ſtraight without ſerags or knobs.</p>
                        <p>In any wiſe cut no more ſtalks then you ſhall carry away within one hour or two at the moſt, for if in the mean time the Sun ſhine hot, and it happen to rain, the Hops (remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut in that ſort) will be much impaired thereby.</p>
                        <p>Let all ſuch as help you ſtand round about the Floore, and ſuffer them not to pingle in picking one by one, but let them ſpeedily ſtrip them into Baskets prepared ready therefore.</p>
                        <p>It is not hurtfull greatly, though the ſmaller Leaves be mingled with the Hops, for in them is retained great vertue, inſomuch as in <hi>Flanders</hi> they were ſold <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1566 for xxvi. ſhillings viii. pence the Hundred, no one Hop being mingled with them.</p>
                        <p>Remember alwayes to clear your Floor twice or thrice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, and ſweep it clean at every ſuch time, before you go to work again.</p>
                        <p>If the weather be unlike to be fair, you may carry theſe Hops into your houſe in Blankets or Baskets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there accompliſh this work. Uſe no Linnen hereabouts, for the Hops will ſtain it ſo, as it can never be waſhed out.</p>
                        <p>If your poles be ſeraggy, ſo as you cannot ſtrip the ſtalks from them in this order, you muſt pull them up with main force before the Hops be gathered, and this is painfull to your ſelf, hurtfull to your Hops, and a delay to your work.</p>
                        <p>Then muſt you lay theſe poles upon a couple of forked ſtalks driven into the ground, being two or three yards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant one from another, as Spits upon Ranges, and ſo diſpatch this buſineſſe, if the weather be fair, if it be like to be foul, you muſt be fain to carry the Hops together with the pole
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:118810:65"/> into your Barn or houſe, that they may not take wet, and ſo be made uſeleſſe.</p>
                        <p>In any wiſe let not the Hops be wet when you cut them from the hills, neither make any delay of gathering after the ſame time of cuttings, for in ſtanding abroad they will ſhed their ſeed, wherein conſiſteth the chief vertue of the Hop, and hereof I cannot warn you too often, nor too earneſtly.</p>
                        <p>Now by order I ſhould declare unto you the manner of drying your Hops, but becauſe I muſt therewithall deſcribe the places meet for that purpoſe, with many circumſtances appertaining thereunto, I will be bold, firſt to finiſh the work within your Hop-Garden, and then to lead you out of the ſame, into the place where you muſt dry your Hops, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>When your Hops are gathered, aſſoon as you have leiſure, take up your Poles and pile them (that remain good) as I have ſhewed you in the Title of Poles.</p>
                        <p>Then carry out your broken Poles, and your Hop-ſtraw to the fire.</p>

                        <p>In the firſt year (I mean) at the firſt time of cutting and dreſſing of your roots, you muſt (with a ſharp knife) cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all ſuch roots or ſprings as grew the year before out of your Sets, within one inch of the ſame.</p>
                        <p>Every year after you muſt cut them as cloſe as you can to the old roots, even as you ſee an Oſiers head cut.</p>
                        <p>There groweth out of the old Sets certain roots, right downwards, not joynted at all, which ſerve only for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and comfort of thoſe Sets or principall roots, which are not to be cut off. There be other like unto them growing outward at the fides of the Sets. If theſe be not met withall, and cut aſunder, they will cucumber your whole Garden.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe it may ſeem hard to diſcern the old Sets from the new ſprings, I thought good to advertiſe you how eaſie a thing it is to ſee the difference thereof; for firſt you ſhall be ſure to find your Sets where you did ſet them, nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in length, but ſomewhat in bigneſſe enlarged, and in few years all your Sets will be grown into one, ſo as by the quantity that thing ſhall plainly appear: and laſtly the difference is ſeen by the colour, the old root being red, the other white, but if the hills be not yearly pulled down, and the roots yearly cut, then indeed the old Sets ſhall not be perceived from the other roots.</p>
                        <p>If your Sets be ſmall, and placed in good ground, and the hill well maintained, the new Roots will be greater than the old.</p>

                        <p>And ſome that take upon them great skill herein, think that for the firſt year they may be left unhilled and uncut, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> deceiving themſelves with this conceit, that then the Sets proſper beſt within the ground, when they ſend leaſt of their nature and ſtate out of the ground. In this reſpect alſo they pull away or ſuppreſſe all ſuch Springs (as ſoon as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear) which grow more, and beſides them which they mean to aſſign to each Pole, as though when a mans finger were cut off, his hand would grow the greater. Indeed if there be no hill maintained, then the more Springs are ſuffered to grow out from the principall root, the more burden and puniſhment it will be to the ſame. But when the Springs are maintained with a hill, ſo much as remaineth within the ſame is converted into roots, which rather adde than take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any ſtate from the principall root, in conſideration here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the ſuppreſſing of the Springs may not be too rathe, for whatſoever opinion be hereof received, the many Springs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hurt the principall root, if the the hills be well maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but it is the cumbring and ſhadowing of one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that worketh the annoyance.</p>
                        <p>When you have cut your Hops, you muſt cover them as you were taught in the Title of Setting, and proceeding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order already ſet down.</p>

                        <p>THe firſt buſineſſe that is to be done herein, is to go up to the bed of the Oſte, and there to receive baskets filled with Hops, at the hands of one that ſtandeth below.</p>

                        <p>You ſhall not need to lay the wood through to the further end of your Furnace, for the fire made in the forepart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, will bend that way, ſo as the heat will univerſally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently aſcend and proceed out of every hole.</p>

                        <p>The way to help that matter, is to tak a little Pole (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you ſhall ſenfibly feel and perceive which be, and which be not dry, by the rattling of the Hops which you ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with touch) and with the ſame Pole to turn-aſide ſuch Hops as be not dry, abating the thickneſſe to the moiſt place.</p>

                        <p>As for any low rooms or earthen floors, they are yet worſe for this purpoſe than the other, for either they yield duſt in dryneſſe, or moiſture in wet weather.</p>
                        <p>And therefore if you have no Oſte, dry them in a Loft as open to the air as may be: ſweep, waſh and rub the boards, and let your Broom reach to the walls, and even to the roof of your Loft, for I can teach you no way to divide the duſt from your Hops, but ſo to prevent the inconvenience hereof.</p>
                        <p>Stop the holes and chinks of your floor, lay them not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove half a foot thick, and turn them once a day at the leaſt, by the ſpace of two or three weeks.</p>

                        <p>But the handſommer way were to make a ſquare hole (as wide as the Sacks mouth) in the floor of the loft, where your Hops lye, and to hang down your Sack at that hole, and with a Scuppet or ſhovell to ſhove down your Hops therein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and to receive them as is aforeſaid: when the Sack is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt full, undo the Ropes, and wind thoſe pinnes about for the harder ſhutting of the Sack, and faſten them therein.</p>

With us in <hi>England</hi> generally it is called Tabaco, the ſhape and forme whereof very much reſembleth the greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry, inſomuch that ſome would take it, or rather miſtake it for great Comfry, they may rather deeme it to be yellow Henbane, they are not much unlike. It hath a thick round ſtalk nere about two foot high, whereon do grow fat green leaves, but not ſo large as that which grows in the Indies, ſomewhat round pointed, not being notched or cut in the edges, and bigger down ward towward the root than it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: while it is young it is leaved, and putteth forth ſome branches diſtant from one another halfe a foot, whereby it is furniſhed with leaves, and putting forth ſeverall joynts, at length it grows to a great height. The ſtalk branching forth beareth at the tops ſundry flowers coming out of a ſwad or husk, having the faſhion of a bell, ſcarce ſtanding above the brinks of the husk: no ſooner are the flowers gone, but the ſeeds appeare, which are very ſmall, not much unlike the ſeeds of yellow henbane; when they are not yet ripe they are of a green colour, but when they be ripe, they are of a black colour. The roots are not very great nor woody, but peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:118810:74"/> but that, not withſtanding the hard froſts in winter, it ſprouts up againe in the Spring.</p>
                     <p>The ſeeds were firſt brought from ſome remote part of the world into this Commonwealth not many yeares ſince, and were it not for its phyſicall qualities that it hath, more than the great benefit which will redound to this Nation by planting it (being not of veric great eſteeme) I had ſpared this labour: and my chiefe reaſon for this is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am of opinion, that hearbs either tranſplanted, or brought in ſeed into this Land, (if it ſhall agree with the ſoyl) will agree better with the conſtitution of our bodies, than that which is brought from any forrein part from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas.</p>

                        <p>THe moſt fruitfull and fertil ſoyle naturally, or by art ſo made, is moſt requiſite for this purpoſe: if the Soyle be naturally fat and ſtrong, regard likewiſe muſt be had of the ſcituation of the ground, whether in field or garden, that the place be not over-ſhadowed with Trees, whereby the Sunne may be hindered from yielding unto it its heat: neither muſt your Tabaco be planted or ſowne in wide &amp; large fields which lies open to all winds and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpecially the North winds. And as unkindly blaſts are a great enemy to the thriving of it on the one ſide, ſo on the other ſide, the want of the comfort of the heat of the Sunne will ſo chill it, that it will never come to perfection.</p>
                        <p>But if by Art: your ground muſt be well dunged and manured, which ought to be mixed and incorporated with the earth, that there may not be the leaſt appearance of Dung. Moreover the Dung you ſo make uſe of muſt lie a long time rotting, if it be gathered out of the ſtable: Your beſt ſoyle therefore for preſent occaſion is ſuch as is taken up in the ſtreets, or elſe Aſhes ſifted.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:118810:74"/> Your Hops and Tabaco will require the ſelfe manuring, and I am of opinion that ſuch lands as they ſow their Hempe in, muſt needs be fit for this purpoſe, becauſe it is fat and mellow.</p>

                        <p>SOme are of opinion that the Seeds ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly caſt abroad without either ſowing or raking, the ground being firſt prepared with the Plough or the Spade.</p>
                        <p>Others againe will tell you, that you muſt make a ſmall hole in the ground with your finger, about the depth of your fingers length, wherein you may put ten or twelve ſeeds, and ſo cover the hole againe: and this reaſon they give for their ſo doing: for ſay they, the ſeeds being very ſmall, are either ſubject to be blowne away by every ſmall winde: or elſe parched by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame ſcorching heat of the Sunne. I prefer this way before the former.</p>
                        <p>Others againe would have us ſow the ſeeds as Lettu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and other ſmall ſeeds are committed to the ground, by taking ſome of the fineſt moulde, and putting it into a platter of wood, or ſome ſuch like veſſell, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the earth very well with the ſeed, and ſo caſt to it on the ground very thinne and ſparingly. This may be their reaſon, becauſe the ſeed being mixed ſo well with the earth, will ſtick cloſe to ſome ſmall crummes of earth, that the wind cannot diſperſe it, and beſides it occaſioneth the ſpeedier rooting thereof, and ſomewhat ſhelters it, that the heat of the Sunne will not much annoy it: but if you ſhall put a ſmall quantity of Aſhes very finely ſifted into the veſſell among the earth and ſeeds, it would be much better.</p>

                        <p>But the beſt way, as I conceive, to preſerve them is by removing them in the winter, the manner thus: Take up the root with the earth about them, put all into ſome pot or any other thing fit for the purpoſe, and ſet them in a warme place about your houſe, and let it abide there all the winter, but if the Sun chance to ſhine very hot, afford your Plant the benefit thereof for one hour or two, and ſo returne it to its former place, this is the moſt certaine way to preſerve roots and Plants all the Winter, and in the Spring ſet them into the ground with the ſame earth about them.</p>

                  <head>Certaine common Instructions how the Stumpe muſt be choſen whereupon you will graffe or plant.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very diligent Houſholder who will plant, ſhould uſe thereto a convenient place, to the end, that the wild beaſt chaw not, nor paire the plants; or if they be young, wholly eat in pieces; which to avoid, is needfull to be in a towne or cloſed Orchard, where there is not too much ſhadow, but a ſweet ground well muckt, tilled and turned.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Every Plant will have foure things.</head>
                     <p>Firſt moiſtneſſe, ſo that the ſeeds or ſtumpe bee moiſt or green.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a convenient place, which hath ſuch earth as will lightly be rubbed to pouder, and that Sun may come to it; for where there is filthy lome, a lean ground, or ſandy, dry, burnt, or ſalt ground, there is nothing good to be planted, to have any continuance; nevertheleſſe where the ground is lean, there you muſt give more dung; in a fat ground not ſo much. Take heed the ground be not too moiſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118810:79"/> nor too dry; and muck the trees with hogs dung.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, a mediate water or nouriſhing moiſtneſs, therefore be thoſe Orchards beſt which are ſcituated between two waters; for thoſe that are placed by a water ſide, remaine ſtill young and fruitfull, and have commonly the bark ſmoother and thinner than the others. And thoſe trees are more fruitful then others which are planted in a vally, or in the lower part of a deep hill; for from thoſe hils may come to them nouriſhment and moiſtneſs, and the ground which is ſo ſcituated is very fruitfull. But he that cannot get for his trees ſuch a ground, muſt with all diligence ſeek to bring to his trees a little ſpring or pond, of which the trees may ſometimes find ſome reviving, and if you may not have any of thoſe, and have a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den who by it ſelfe is naught, the trees wil grow with thick roots, which hindereth the growing of them, and drieth them at length.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the air is required, which muſt be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them, and of complexion to bear; for there be ſome trees that doe proſper in all aires, to wit, apple, and peare, cherry and plum-trees. Some will have a cold air, to wit, cheſnut-trees; and ſome a very warm aire, as the palme and pepper trees: therefore they be rare with us. That plant which hath theſe four things ſhall proſper: and if they want one or more of theſe four things, they will decay and their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring periſh.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>At what time trees ought to be planted and ſet.</head>
                     <p>ALL kind of trees may be planted, tranſported, and cut in March, but it is better to turn them in October, for then the froſt hurteth them not ſo
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118810:79"/> much as at other times; for learned men ſay, that in dry Towns and warm Countries they plant in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or November, and that in moiſt Towns and cold vallies, they plant in February or March: in none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time may you plant or graffe. When you will plant or ſet againe wild ſtumps, if there be any thing broken at the root, cut it off. Every plant muſt be ſet two foot one from another, or at the leaſt one foot, eſpecially when they ſhould beare ſtrong fruites: likewiſe when thou wilt ſet ſtrong ſeeds, as nuts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and peaches. When a man will plant two ſtumps, ſo muſt they be of two yeare old, except the vine.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things you muſt underſtand of thoſe plants or ſtumps which are planted with roots.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>How the ſtumps and plants muſt be prepared and dreſſed, which you will plant.</head>
                     <p>THe plant or ſprout you muſt cut round about, ſo that you leave the very end of it, and put it then into a hole, but if the ſtump be great, cut it clean off, and then put only the undermoſt part into a hole, long or ſhort as you will; but if you find two ſtumps grown together, you may cut the leſſer away. And above all things, you muſt take heed that the ſprout grow upright, and if it will not, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine it, and tie it to a ſtick.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Here follow certaine inſtructions how the trees muſt be kept, and how you muſt labour them.</head>
                     <p>SOme trees will have a fat ground, as Figge trees and Mulberrie trees, and ſome leane ground, but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118810:80"/> all trees be in that point equall, that they will have in the top dry ground, and in the bottome moiſt earth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In Harveſt you muſt uncover the roots of the trees ſo deep, that they may partly be ſeen, and lay dung upon them, which dung muſt be diſſolved of raine in the ground, that it may come to the roots, which mucking giveth good increaſe to the roots.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If the ground wherein the trees ſtand bee too ſandy, then mix among it faire and new lome; and if it bee too lomy, then mix amongſt it ſand in place of mucke, the which you muſt not only doe hard by the tree, but alſo four or five foot off from it round about the tree, according as the tree is in bigneſſe, or that the roots are large and great.</p>
                     <p>Such diligence, giveth to the trees great help, for their nouriſhment and ſtrength is thereby renewed. Hereafter you ſhall underſtand, whereby to know the fruitfull ſoile.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In the fat ground, the ſtumps whereupon you wil graff, muſt be left long, but in lean ground ſhort.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The plants of trees from their youth, till three years muſt not be cut nor ſhred, but they may bee tranſported, and if they be too weak you may pricke ſticks next unto them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Diligent regard muſt be taken, that no ſprouts ſpring out of the ſtump, which might take the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from the tree ſprouts, and thoſe boughes which ſpring from the root of the tree at the firſt planting.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. When thou perceiveſt the young trees to wax weake, then uncover the roots and put other freſh ground to them.</p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118810:80"/>
                     <p n="8"> 8. If the ground be neither too ſoft nor too hard, then may you chuſe all kind of ſtumps in February for to plant, when the green juice is diſperſed in the bark; but when the ground is too hard, then the ſwet holes or pores of the root doe remaine cloſed and ſtopped, ſo that they cannot draw to them their nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, ſuch hardneſs of the ground or earth hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the aire and moiſtneſſe which commeth from beneath upward, for it cannot be pierced of the ſoft ſprouts, with the ſmall heat which is beneath, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt come to help them with a ſpade, for with a plough you will never come to an end, becauſe of the root.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. There is great diligence to be taken for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of the trees, when they begin to grow great, to ſcrape from the barke all rudeneſſe which is done, when you take from them all ſuperfluity and ſprouts which come out of the tree. You may cut them in February.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. It is good for the trees to muck them often, and moderatively to water their roots.</p>
                     <p>Alſo to cleave the roots, and lay ſtones into them, to the end they may revive againe of the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which they have ſuffered, or of the barrenneſſe of the ground, or when the young planted trees for the great heat will periſh. Alſo when immoderate heat is, then you muſt help them with turning of the ground, and with watering, but the water wherewith you ſhould water them, muſt not be altogether freſh nor cold, or newly drawne out of the ſpring, but out of a ditch, pond, or well, or any other foule ditch wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or with ſpring water, which hath ſtood long in the Sunne, or put a little dun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118810:81"/> it once or twice well about, and the water will be fat wherwith water your trees. You may alſo keep them with ſhadowes and ſtraw from the heat: or elſe put (in great heat) fat green herbs at the ſtump, tempred with loame: ſome anoint the ſtumpe (toward the South or Mid-day) with chalke, ſome with oile, or with any other ointment that cooleth.</p>

                     <p>The imping ſprouts muſt be young and new, with great bodies and many eyes: for where many and great buds be, that is a token, that is of a ſtrong fruit.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The imping ſprouts muſt be broken off at the Sun riſing, although that thoſe of the other ſide bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off grow likewiſe: yet thoſe of the other ſide are moſt naturall and temperate of heat: Some country clownes beleeve, that if you in cutting the ſprouts turne them upſide downe, that they will never grow right, but be crooked.</p>

                        </gap>g is done by putting one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118810:82"/> into another by a faſt binding, that the little ſprout may ſpread his boughs to the ſtump or tree, wherein it is graffed, that ſo it may become one tree.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Over-young imps (which are ſo weak that they will breake before they be put into the earth, or into the ſtump) are naught, and therefore they may not be imped or ſet.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When you impe upon a houſe or fruit tree, the fruit will be far better: But if you cut of a Garden tree a branch, and imp it into one of his own ſprouts, it will bring forth fruit of another taſte, forme, and bigneſſe; for imping maketh all the diverſities in peares, apples, and other fruits.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 It is far better to impe low in the ſtump, than in the top in the high branches: yet nevertheleſſe if you will make of wild apple trees garden trees, you may impe them upon the top.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. In great trees which have a great bark, it is not ſo good to impe, for they take not to them ſo eaſily the veins of the roots which grow out of the young ſprouts, becauſe of their hardneſſe, and eſpecially when the imping ſprouts are too weak. Wherefore they which graffe trees muſt ſeek ſmall and young ſtumps, wherein they finde much liquor and little hardneſſe, and which may endure the binding.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. It is beſt imping or graffing when the liquor is in the bark, if you have a great tree upon the which you would impe, and hath many branches, you may cut them all off, and impe into the ſtumps all kind of boughs, ſuch as you pleaſe; but if the tree be over-old, ſo that her boughes be ranckled, and her moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe conſumed, then cut the tree clean off, and let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118810:82"/> ſprouts which are ſprung out of that ſtumpe, and graffe them, and caſt the others away. Such a ſtump is like to bear, and therfore nouriſh as many ſprouts as you pleaſe: but if it be a wild ſtump, graft garden ſprouts upon it.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. If you graffe a ſprout or bough upon a Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne tree, that ſame bough will grow great, and the ſtump will remaine ſmall, therefore he that will impe upon ſuch a tree, ſee he cut it off by the root, then will the imped ſprout and the ſtumpe grow all of one thickneſſe: but you muſt have ſtill regard that you impe kinde upon kinde, as apples upon apples, peares upon peares: for he that graffeth ſtrange upon ſtrange, as peares upon apples, and apples on peares, and ſuch like, although it be done often for pleaſures ſake, yet will it not laſt; for the naturall nouriſhment is ſo, that it will hardly nouriſh a ſtrange kinde of fruit.</p>

                     <p>The firſt ſort of graffing is, when the ſprout is prickt between the bark and the wood of the ſtump; which muſt be done in May or Aprill, when the bark may eaſily be looſed from the tree, and is done after this ſort.</p>
                     <p>Firſt take a ſtump or tree, and cut him off with a ſharp Saw, knife or ſuch like inſtrument, where he is ſmootheſt and cleareſt, and full of juice, and poliſh the place with the bark of the ſame tree which was cut off. Afterward ty the ſtump with a piece of bark, and then prick a hole between the barke of the tree with a prick of bone, elderwood or Iron, ſo that it cleave not, and then put in the place of the prick the ſprout, which you muſt have broken off a plaine and even tree, of a good kind, and one year old, which you ſhall know by this; every branch hath rinckled knots like the joint of a mans finger, cut it at one ſide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the knot, ſo that you touch not the heart of the tree, and at the other ſide you muſt ſoftly looſe the barke, that the ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>out may joyne very cloſe to the ſtump, then pull out the prick, and take the ſprout, and turn the green bark to the bark of the ſtumpe, ſo that it may ſtand ſtraight.</p>
                     <p>The ſprout may be foure or five fingers, or eight at the moſt, high above the ſtump.</p>
                     <p>Of this ſort of imping, you may ſee two, three, or more, according to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118810:83"/> he can beare, provided alwaies that they ſtand at the leaſt the length of a finger one from another.</p>
                     <p>Afterward tie it faſt (with bark) together, and put over it good muck, and tie over it a cloath, that no raine or aire may come between it and hurt it. This ſort of imping is commonly uſed in ſtumps, which are great and old trees, whoſe barke is thicke and ſtrong, as apple trees, pear trees, cherry trees, and willow trees, on which are imped oftentimes apples, alſo on figge trees, and cheſtnut trees.</p>
                     <p>Such grafting is alſo done in high ſtumps, and branches, which be great, but they muſt be well kept from the wind, that it doe not break them.</p>
                     <p>After this ſort you may graft many ſorts and kinds of pears upon one tree, but if you bring peares upon apples, or apples upon pears ſtumps, it will not laſt long, as afore is ſaid.</p>

                     <p>TAke a young tree which is ſcant of the bigneſs of a finger, and cut it ſmoothe and even, and cleave it in the midſt, then take the ſprout which you will impe, and cut it three ſquare, and at the one ſide leave the barke uncut, and then turne the ſame bark outward at the ſtump, and tie it faſt as I have taught, that the winde nor raine hurt him not.</p>

This helpeth much to keep the moiſtneſſe in, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the root, that it cannot breake out, but nouriſheth the better the new plant; but when the ſtumps are great, they be cleaved after two waies. The firſt is, that you cut or cleave the tree with a knife at one ſide only, even to the heart, and that you graft into it but one ſprout. The other is, that you cleave it all over, and that you prick or graft on every ſide one ſprout, or one alone, and leave the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide without.</p>
                     <p>When the ſtump is but a little bigger, then the ſprout muſt neceſſarily be cloven in two, and you muſt graft but one ſprout into it, as is ſaid in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                     <p>This cleaving may be done in February, March, and Aprill, then it is good to cut them before they be greene, for to keepe them the better under the ground, in cold or moiſt places.</p>

                     <p>THis ſort of grafting is very ſubtill, witty, and ready; and is done as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Go to a ſmooth apple or peare tree, in April, when the trees get liquor, and ſeeke a branch which hath green eyes, and ſee that the ſame be leſſe than your little finger, and teare it from the tree, and where you ſee that the green ſprouts will come off, there cut them off wholly, and cleanſe the middle there of, that the little red at the wood may turne about, and draw it not off, untill you come unto another good peare or apple tree, and ſeek there another branch of the ſame bigneſſe that the other was, and cut it off, and take from it likewiſe the red, as far as you will put them again, and look where the branches join, that they may well ſit together upon the top, and tie the ſame place gently and well with a little barke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde and before, that the water may not hurt them: in the firſt year it bringeth forth leaves and branches, in the ſecond floures, which you may breake off, for the ſprout is yet too tender, ſo that it may bear no fruit, and in the third yeare it bringeth floures and fruit, and by this meanes you may graft divers kinds of peares and apples upon one tree. I have likewiſe ſet ſuch ſprouts upon wild ſtumps, and they have proſpered.</p>

                     <p>When you ſee upon a great fruitfull bough, a bud which will proſper without doubt, and wouldſt faine plant it upon another tree, take a ſharp knife, and lift the bark up two fingers breadth, that the bud be not hurt, then goe to another tree, upon the which you will graft, and put into a convenient place, a like hole into the bark, and put the ſame bud with the bark in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and tie it with dung (or with a clout that hath lien in a dunghill) over the cut, that it may be kept from the outward damage of weather, and for an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall nouriſhment and keeping of the inner juice: then cut off the branches round about it, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may the better nouriſh the new ſonne; within twenty days after take away the band, ſo that you ſee that the ſtrange bud hath proſpered, and joyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the tree. This may be done in March, when the bark cometh eaſily from the tree. Alſo in April, May, and Iune, and yet ſhee proſpereth both before and after a time, when you may conveniently finde ſuch buds.</p>
                     <p>This ſort of planting proſpereth beſt in a willow tree or ſuch like, which is pierced through, and is done after this ſort.</p>

Theſe alſo are letted from increaſing; yea, they in heaps preſently gathered are deſtroied, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> report of obſervation, if the Gardener by taking cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Palmer or Canker-wormes out of the Garden next joyning, ſhall ſeeth them in water with Dill, and the ſame being through cold, ſhall ſprinckle on the herbes and trees, that the mixture may wet and ſoke through the neſts, even unto the young ones, cleaving together, that they may taſte thereof, will ſpeedily diſpatch them. But in this doing, the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener muſt be very wary, and have an attentive eye, that none of the mixture fall on his face or hands.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe, the owner or Gardener may uſe this remedy certain, and eaſily prepared, if about the big armes of trees, or ſtumps of the herbs, he kindle and burn the ſtronger lime and brimſtone together. Or if the owner make a ſmoake with the Muſhromes, growing under the Nut tree, or burne the hoofs of Goats, or the gum <hi>Galbanum,</hi> or elſe make a ſmoak with the Harts horne, the winde aiding, by blowing towards them.</p>
                     <p>The husbandmen and gardeners in our turne have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118810:92"/> found out this eaſie practiſe, being now common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where: which is on this wiſe, that when theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſhowres of rain are cropen into the warm ſun, or into places ſtanding againſt the Sunne, early in the morning ſhake either their fruits and leaves of the pot-herbes, or the boughes of the trees, for theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet ſtiffe, through the cold of the night, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of the ſame, the lighter and ſooner to fall, nor able after to recover up againe, ſo that the Palmer worms thus lying on the ground, are then in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to be killed of the Gardener.</p>
                     <p>If the owner mind to deſtroy any other creeping things noyous to herbes and trees, (which <hi>Paladius</hi> and <hi>Rutilius</hi> name, both herb and Leek-waſters) then let him hearken to this invention and deviſe of the Greek <hi>Dyophanes,</hi> who willeth to purchaſe the maw of a Wether ſheep new killed, and the ſame as yet full of his excrementall filth, which lightly cover with the earth in the ſame place, where theſe moſt haunt in the Garden, and after two dayes ſhall the Gardiner find there, that the mothes with long bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and other creeping things will be gathered in divers companies to the place right over it, which the owner ſhall either remove and carry further, or dig and bury very deep in the ſame place, that they may not after ariſe and come forth, which when the Gardener ſhall have exerciſed the ſame but twice or thrice, he ſhall utterly extinguiſh, and quite deſtroy all the kindes of creeping things that anoy and ſpoil the Garden plants.</p>
                     <p>The husbandmen in <hi>Flanders</hi> arme the ſtockes, and compaſſe the bigger armes of their trees, with wiſps of ſtraw handſomely made and faſtened or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118810:93"/> bound about, by which the Palmer wormes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to creep up to the tops of the trees, and there ſtaid, ſo that, (as it were by ſnares and engines laid) theſe in the end are driven away, or thus in their way begun, are ſpeedily or ſoone after procured to turne backe againe; As unto the remedies of the Snailes particularly belongs. Theſe may the Gardener like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe chaſe from the kitchin herbs, if he either ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckle the new mother of the oyle olive, or ſoot of the chimney on the herbs, as if he beſtowed the bitter ſitch in beds among them, which alſo availes againſt other noiſome worms, and creeping things, as I afore uttered, that if the Gardener would poſſeſſe a greene and delectable Garden, let him then ſprinckle dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently all the quarters, beds, and borders of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with the mixture of water and powder of Fenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeke tempered together, or ſet upright in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Garden, the whole bare head without the fleſh of the unchaſte Aſſe, as I afore wrote.</p>

                     <p>THe skilfull <hi>Paxanus</hi> hath left in writing, that if the Gardener ſhould make hollow a big nut, or bore a hollow hole into ſome ſound piece of wood being narrow, in filling the one or the other with Roſin, Pitch, Chaffe and Brimſtone, of each ſo much as ſhall ſuffice to the filling of the Nut, or hollow hole in the wood, which thus prepared in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſtop every where with diligence, all the goings Forth, and breathing holes of the Mole, that by thoſe the fuming ſmoke in no manner may iſſue out, yet

                        <hi>Albertus</hi> of worthy memory reporteth, that if the owner or Gardener cloſeth or diligently ſtoppeth the mouths of the Moleholes, with the garlicke, ony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or leek, it ſhall either drive the Moles away, or kil them through the ſtrong ſavour ſtinking or brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing into them.</p>

I met with a man, and upon our Diſcourſe he fell out with me: this man having a good wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, having neither wit, ſtomack, nor skill; I ſay this man may come home by <hi>Totnam-high-Croſs,</hi> and cauſe the Clerk to tole his knell: It is the very like caſe with the Gentleman Angler that goeth to the River for his pleaſure: this Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler hath neither judgement, knowledge, nor experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; he may come home light laden at his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>A man that goeth to the River for his pleaſure, muſt underſtand, when he commeth there, to ſet forth his Tackles. The firſt thing he muſt do, is to obſerve the Sun, the Wind, the Moon, the Starres, and the Wanes of the Air; to ſet forth his Tackles according to the times and ſeaſons; to goe for his pleaſure, and ſome profit.</p>
                  <p>As for example, the Sun proves cloudy; then muſt he ſet forth either his ground Bait or Tackles, and of the brighteſt of his Flies. If the Sun prove bright, then muſt he put on ſome of the darkeſt of his flies. Thus muſt you goe to work with your Flies, light for darkneſs, and dark for lightneſs, with the wind in the South, then that blows the Flie in the Trouts mouth. Though I ſet down the wind being in the South, if the weather be warm, I am indifferent where the wind ſtandeth, either with ground Bait
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118810:107"/> or Menow, ſo that I can caſt my Bait into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The very ſame obſervations is for night, as for day: For if the Moon prove cleer, or if the Stars glitter in the skie, there is as ill Angling that night, as if it were at high noon in the midſt of Summer, when the Sun ſhineth at the brighteſt, wherein there is no hopes of pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>I will begin to Angle for the Trout, with the ground Baits with this quality.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing you muſt gaine, muſt be a neat taper Rod, light before, with a tender hazell top, which is very gentle. If you deſire to attain my way of Angling, (for I have Angled theſe forty years) with a ſingle haire of five lengths, one tied to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the bottom of my Line, and a Line of three haired links for the uppermoſt part; &amp; ſo you may kill the greateſt Trout that ſwims, with Sea-room.</p>
                  <p>He that Angles with a Line made of three haired links at the bottom, and more at the top, may kill Fiſh: but he that Angles with one hair ſhall kill five Trouts to the others one; for the Trout is very quick ſighted; therefore the beſt way for night or day, is to keep out of the ſight. You muſt Angle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with the point of your Rod downe the ſtream; for a Fiſh hath not the quickneſs of ſight ſo perfect up the ſtream, as oppoſite againſt him, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſeaſonable times; as for example, we begin to Angle in <hi>March;</hi> If it prove cloudie, you may Angle with the ground Baits all day long: but if it prove bright and cleere, you muſt take the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening, or elſe you are not like to do any good; ſo the times muſt be obſerved, and truely underſtood; for when an Angler commeth to the River for his pleaſure that doth not underſtand to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118810:107"/> ſet forth his Tackles fit for the time, it is as good keep them in the bag, as ſet them forth.</p>
                  <p>I am determined to Angle with the ground Baits and ſet my Tackles to my Rod, and go to my pleaſure: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the uppermoſt part of the ſtreame, carrying my Line with an upright hand, feeling the Plummet run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on the ground ſome ten inches from the hook, plumming my Line according to the ſwiftneſſe of the ſtream you Angle in; for one plummet will not ſerve for all ſtreams; for the true Angling is that the plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met runneth on the ground.</p>
                  <p>For the Bait. The red knotted worme is very good where Brandlins are not to be had, but Brandlins are better: now that you may bring theſe Brandlings fit to Angle with, that they may live long on the hook, which cauſeth the beſt ſport. When you have gathered your worms out of the dung-hill, you muſt gaine the greeneſt Moſs you can find, then waſh the earth very clean out of it, then provide an earthen pot, ſo put your Moſs into the pot, then put the worms to the Moſs into the pot; within two days you ſhall find your worms ſo poor, that if you bait ſome of them on your hook, you ſhall ſee that with throwing of them two or three times into the water, they will dye and grow white: now the skill is, when theſe worms be grown poor, you muſt feed them up to make them fat and luſty, that they may live long on the hook; that is the chiefeſt point.</p>
                  <p>To make them luſty and fat, you muſt take the yolke of an Egge, ſome eight or ten ſpoonfull of the top of new milk, beaten well together in a Porringer, warm it a little, untill you ſee it curdle; then take it off the fire, and ſet it to coole; when it is cold, take a ſpoonfull and drop it upon your Moſs into the pot, every drop about the bigneſſe of a green Pea, ſhifting your Moſs twice in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118810:108"/> the week in the Summer, and once in the winter: thus doing, you ſhall feed your wormes fat, and make them luſty, that they will live a long time on the hook; ſo you may keep them all the year long. This is my true experience for the ground Baits, for the running Line for the Trout.</p>
                  <p>The Angling with a Menow, called in ſome places Pencks for a Trout, is a pleaſant ſport, and killeth the greateſt Fiſh; be commeth boldly to the Bait, as if it were a Maſtive Dog at a Beare: you may Angle with greater Tackles, and ſtronger, &amp; be no prejudice to you in your Angling: a Line made of three ſilks and three hairs twiſted for the uppermoſt part of the Line, and two ſilkes and two haires twiſted for the bottome next your hook, with a Swivel nigh the middle of your Line, with an indifferent large hook.</p>
                  <p>To bait your hook with a Menow, you muſt put your hook through the lowermoſt part of his mouth, ſo draw your hook thorow, then put the hook in at the mouth againe, let the point of the hook come out at the hindmoſt Fin, then draw your Line, and the Menowes mouth will cloſe, that no water will get into its belly; you muſt alwayes be Angling with the point of your Rod down the ſtream, with drawing the Menow up the ſtream by little and little, nigh the top of the water; the Trout ſeeing the bait, commeth at it moſt fiercely, ſo give a little time before you ſtrike: This is the true way, without Lead; for many times I have had them come at the Lead and forſake the Menow, ſo he that tryeth ſhall prove it in time: let us go to Angling with a Flie, which is a delightfull ſport.</p>
                  <p>The Rod muſt be light and tender, if you can fit your ſelfe with an Hazell, either of one piece or two ſet together in the moſt convenient manner, light and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118810:108"/> gentle: ſet your Line to the Rod; for the uppermoſt part, you may uſe your owne diſcretion; for the lower part, next your Flie, muſt be of three or foure haired links. If you can attain to Angle with one haire, you ſhall have the more riſes, and kill more fiſh; be ſure you doe not over-load your ſelf with the length of your Line: before you begin to Angle, make a triall, having the winde in your back, to ſee at what length you can caſt your Flie, that the Flie light firſt into the water, and no longer; for if any of the Line falleth into the water before the Flie, it is better unthrowne then throwne: be ſure you be caſting alwayes downe the ſtream, with the Wind behinde you, and the Sun before; it is a ſpeciall point to have the Sunne and Moon before you; for the very motion of the Rod drives all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from you, either by day or night in all your Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, both for Wormes and Flies; ſo there muſt bee a great care of that.</p>
                  <p>Let us begin to Angle in <hi>March</hi> with the Flie: If the weather prove Windie, or Cloudie, there are ſeverall kindes of Palmers that are good for that time.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a black Palmer ribbed with ſilver: the ſecond, a black Palmer with an Orange-tauny body: thirdly, a black Palmer, with the body made all of black: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a red Palmer ribbed with gold, and a red hackle mixed with Orenge cruel; theſe Flies ſerve all the year long morning and evening, windie and cloudie. Then if the Aire prove bright and cleare, you muſt imitate the Hauthorn Flie, which is all black and very ſmall, and the ſmaller the better. In <hi>May</hi> take the May-flie: imitate that, which is made ſeverall wayes; ſome make them with a ſhammy body, ribbed with a black haire: another way made with Sandy-Hogges wooll, rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with black ſilke, and winged with a Mallards
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118810:109"/> feather, according to the fancy of the Angler. There is another called the Oak-Flie, which is made of Orange colour Cruell and black, with a browne wing; imitate that: Another Flie, the body made with the ſtrain of a Pea-Cocks feather, which is very good in a bright day: The Graſſe-hopper which is green, imitate that; the ſmaller the Flies be made, and of indifferent ſmall hooks, they are the better; theſe ſorts I have ſet downe, will ſerve all the year long, obſerving the times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Note, the lighteſt of your Flies for cloudy and darkneſſe, and the darkeſt of your Flies for lightneſſe, and the reſt for indifferent times; that a mans owne Judgement, with ſome experience and diſcretion muſt guide him: If he mean to kill Fiſh, he muſt alter his Flies according to theſe directions. Now, of late, I have found, that Hogs-wooll, of ſeverall colours, makes good grounds; and the wooll of a red Heyfer makes a good body: And Bears wool makes a good ground; ſo I now work much of them, and it procureth very much ſport.</p>
                  <p>The naturall Flie is ſure Angling, and will kill great ſtore of Trouts with much pleaſure: As for the May-Flie, you ſhall have them alwayes playing at the River ſide, eſpecially againſt Raine. The Oake-Flie is to bee had on the butt of an Oake, or an Aſh, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>May</hi> to the end of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> it is a browniſh Flie, and ſtands alwayes with his head towards the root of the tree, very eaſie to be found: The ſmall black Flie is to be had on every Hawthorn Buſh, after the buds be come forth: Your Graſſe-hopper, which is green, is to be had in any Medow of Graſſe in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July:</hi> with theſe Flies, you muſt Angle with ſuch a Rod as you Angle with the ground Bait; the Line muſt not be ſo long as the Rod: with drawing your flie, as you finde
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118810:109"/> convenient in your Angling. When you come to deep waters that ſtand ſomewhat ſtill, make your Line ſome two yards long, or thereabout, and dop your Flie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde a a Buſh, which Angling I have had good ſport at; we call it doping.</p>
                  <p>A Lord lately ſent to me at Sun going down, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide him a good diſh of Trouts againſt the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by ſix of the Clock: I went to the door to ſee how the wains of the Aire were like to prove, and returned anſwer, that I doubted not but to be provided (God willing) at my time appointed. I went preſently to the River, and it proved very dark; I drew out a Line of three ſilkes and three hairs twiſted for the uppermoſt part, and a Line of two ſilks and two hairs twiſted for the lowermoſt part, with a good large hook: I baited my hook with two Lob-worms, the four ends hanging as meet as I could gheſſe them in the dark: I fell to Angle; it proved very dark, that I had good ſport, Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the Lob-worms, as I doe with the Flie, at the top of the water; you ſhall heare the Fiſh riſe at the top of the water, then you muſt looſe a ſlack Line down to the bottome, as nigh as you can gheſſe, then hold a ſtraight Line; feeling the Fiſh bite, give time, there is no doubt of loſing the Fiſh; for there is not one among twenty, but doth gorge the Bait: the leaſt ſtroak you can ſtrike to faſten the hook, makes the fiſh ſure, and then you may take the fiſh up with your hands: The night began to alter and grew ſomewhat lighter; I took off the Lob-worms, and ſet to my Rod a white Palmer Flie, made of a large hook, I had ſport for the time, till it grew lighter: then I put on my red Palmer, I had ſport for the time, untill it grew very light; then I ſet on my black Palmer, had good ſport, made up my diſh of fiſh, put up my Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> Flies, with the help
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118810:110"/> of the Lob-worms, ſerve to Angle all the year long, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the times, as I have ſhewed in this nights work: a light Flie for darknes, the red Flie <hi>in medio,</hi> and a dark Flie for lightneſſe: This is my experiment for this kind of Angling, which is the ſureſt Angling of all, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the greateſt Fiſh: your Lines may be ſtrong, but muſt be no longer then the Rod.</p>
                  <p>To take a Carp either in Pond or River, if you mean to have ſport with ſome profit, you muſt take a peck of Ale-graines, and a good quantity of any bloud, and mix the bloud and graines together, and caſt it in the places where you meane to Angle; this feed will gather the ſeale Fiſh together, as Carp, Tench, Roach, Dace, and Bream; the next morning be at your ſport very early, plum your ground: you may Angle for the Carp with a ſtrong Line; the Bait muſt be either a red knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worm, or Paſte: there is no doubt of ſport.</p>
                  <p>To take Pearch. The Pearch feeds well, if you light where they be, and bites very free: My opinion is, (with ſome experience) to bait with Lob-worms, chopt in pieces over night; ſo come in the morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, plum your ground, gage your line, bait your hook with a red knotted worme; but I hold a Menow better: put the hook in at the back of the Menow, betwixt the fiſh and the skin, that the Menow may ſwim up and down alive, being boyed up with a Cork or Quill, that the Menow may have liberty to ſwimme a foot off the the ground: there is no doubt of ſport with profit.</p>
                  <p>I will ſhew, a little, my opinion of floating for ſcale Fiſh in the River or Pond: The feed brings the Fiſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as the ſheep to the Pen: There is nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in all your Anglings, for feed, then Bloud and Grains, I hold it better then Paſte: then plumming your ground, Angling with fine Tackles, as ſingle haire for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118810:110"/> halfe the Line next the hook, round and ſmall plumed, according to your float: For the Bait, there is a ſmall red worm, with a yellow tip on his taile, is very good; Brandlins, Gentles, Paſte, or Cadice, which we call Cod-bait, they lye in a gravelly husk under ſtones in the River: theſe be the ſpeciall Baits for theſe kinde of Fiſh.</p>
                  <p>One of my name was the beſt Trouler, for a Pike, in this Realme: he laid a wager, that he would take a Pike of four footlong, of Fiſh, within the ſpace of one Moneth, with his Trouling-Rod; ſo he Trouled three weeks and odde dayes, and took many great Pikes, nigh the length, but did not reach the full length, till within the ſpace of three dayes of the time; then he took one, and won the wager. The manner of his Trouling was, with a Hazell Rod of twelve foot long, with a Ring of Wyre in the the top of his Rod, for his Line to runne thorow: within two foot of the bottome of the Rod there was a hole made, for to put in a winde, to turne with a barrell, to gather up his Line, and looſe at his pleaſure; this was his manner of Trouling: But I will pawn my credit, that I will ſhew a way, either in Maior, Pond, or River, that ſhall take more Pikes than any Trouler with his Rod: And thus it is. Firſt, take forked ſtick, a Line of twelve yards long wound upon it, at the upper end, leave about a yard, either to tye a bunch of Sags, or a Bladder, to Boy up the Fiſh, and to carry it from the ground: the Bait muſt be a live Fiſh, either Dace, or Gudgin, or Roach, or a ſmall Trout: the forked ſtick muſt have a ſlit in the one ſide of the fork to put in the Line, that you may ſet your live Fiſh to ſwimme at a gage, that when the Pike taketh the Bait, he may have the full liberty of the Line for his feed.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:118810:111"/>
                  <p>You may turne theſe looſe, either in Pond or River: in the Pond with the winde all day long, the more the better: at night ſet ſome ſmall weight, as may ſtay the Boy, as a Ship lyeth at Anchor, till the Fiſh taketh. For the River, you muſt turne all looſe with the ſtreame; two or three be ſufficient to ſhew pleaſure, gaged at ſuch a depth as they will go currant downe the River; there is no doubt of ſport, if there be Pikes: for the hooks, they muſt be doubled hooks, the ſhanks ſhould be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſhorter then ordinary: my reaſon is, the ſhorter the hook is of the ſhank, it will hurt the live Fiſh the leſſe, and muſt be armed with ſmall wyre well ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but I hold a hook armed with twiſted ſilk to be better, for it will hurt the live Fiſh leaſt.</p>
                  <p>If you arm your hook with wyre, the neeld muſt be made with a ſmall hook at the one end thereof. If you arme with ſilke, the neeld muſt be made with an eye: then muſt you take one of thoſe Baits alive (which you can get) and with one of your neelds enter within a ſtrawes breadth of the Gill of the Fiſh, ſo put the neeld betwixt the skin and the Fiſh; then pull the neeld out at the hindmoſt finne, and draw the arming thorow the Fiſh, untill the hook come to lye cloſe to the Fiſhes bodie: But I hold for thoſe that be armed with wyre to take off the hook, and put the neeld in the hindmoſt ſin and ſo to come forth at the Gill; then put on the hook drawn cloſe to the body, 'twill hurt the live Fſh the leſs, ſo knit the arming with the live Fiſh to the Line; then put off either in Maior or Pond, with the winde, in the River with the ſtream: The more you put off in Maior or Pond, you are like to have the more pleaſure: For the River I have ſhewed you before.</p>
                  <p>There is a time when Pikes goe a Frogging Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and in the River to Sun them, as in May, June and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118810:111"/> July, there is a ſpeedy way to take them, and not to miſſe ſcarce one in twenty.</p>
                  <p>You muſt take a Line of ſix or eight foot long, arm a large hook, of the largeſt ſize that is made; arm it to your Line, lead the ſhank of your hook very handſom, that it may be of ſuch a weight as you may guide the hook at your pleaſure: you may ſtrike the Pike, you ſee, with the bare hook where you pleaſe: this Line and hook doth far exceed ſnaring.</p>
                  <p>The principall ſport to take a Pike, is to take a Gooſe or Gander, or Duck: take one of the Pike Lines I have ſhewed you before: tye the Line under the left wing, and over the right wing, about the body, as a man wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his Belt: turne the Gooſe off into a Pond, where <hi>Pikes</hi> are, there is no doubt of ſport, with great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, betwixt the Gooſe and the <hi>Pike:</hi> It is the greateſt ſport and pleaſure that a noble Gentleman in <hi>Shropſhire</hi> doth give his friends entertainment with.</p>
                  <p>The way to make the beſt paſte is, Take a reaſonable quantity of freſh Butter, as much freſh ſheeps Suet, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable quantity of the ſtrongeſt Cheeſe you can get, with the ſoft of an old ſtale white loafe; beat all this in a Morter till it come to perfect paſte; put as much on your hook as a green peaſe.</p>
                  <p>There are many wayes to take Eeles: I will ſhew you a good way to take a diſh of Eeles. When you ſtay a night or two Angling, take four or five Lines, ſuch as be laid for <hi>Pikes,</hi> of fourteen or fifteen yards long, and at every two yards make a nooſe, to hang a hook armed either to double thred, or ſilk twiſt; for it is better then wyre: Bait your Hooks with Millors-thumbs, Loaches, Menowes, or Gudgins: tye to every nooſe a Line bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: theſe Lines muſt be laid croſſe the River in the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt places, either with ſtones, or pegged, ſo the Line lie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118810:112"/> in the bottome of the river, there is no doubt of taking a diſh of Eeles; you muſt have a ſmall neeld with an eye, to bait your hooks.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſhew how to make Flies: learn to make two Flies, and make all: that is, the Palmer ribbed with ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or gold, and the May-flie: theſe are the ground of all Flies.</p>
                  <p>We will begin to make the Palmer Flie: You muſt arme your Line on the inſide of the hook; take your Sciſers, and cut ſo much of the brown of the Mallards feather, as in your owne reaſon ſhall make the wings, then lay the outmoſt part of the feather next the hook, and the point of the feather towards the ſhanke of the hook, then whip it three or four times about the hook with the ſame ſilk you armed the hook: then make your ſilk faſt: then you muſt take the hackle of the neck of a Cock or Capon, or a Plovers top, which is the beſt, take off the one ſide of the feather, then you muſt take the hackle ſilk, or cruell, gold or ſilver thred; make all theſe faſt at the bent of the hook, then you muſt begin with Cruell, and Silver, or Gold, and work it up to the wings, every bout ſhifting your fingers, and making a ſtop, then the gold will fall right, then make faſt: then worke up the hackle to the ſame place, then make the hackle faſt: then you muſt take the hook betwixt your finger and thumb, in the left hand, with a neeld or pin, part the wings in two: then with the arming ſilk, as you have faſtned all hitherto, whip about as it falleth croſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the wings, then with your thumb you muſt turne the point of the feather towards the bent of the hook, then work three or four times about the ſhank, ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, then view the proportion.</p>
                  <p>For the other Flies: If you make the grounds of Hogs-wooll, ſandy, black, or white; or the wooll of a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118810:112"/> Bear, or of a two year old red Bullock: you muſt work al theſe grounds upon a waxed ſilk, then you muſt arm and ſet on the wings, as I have ſhewed before: For the May-flie, you work the body with ſome of theſe grounds, which is very good, ribbed with a black hair; you may work the body with Cruels, imitating the Colour, or with Silver, with ſuiting the wings. For the Oak-flie, you muſt make him with Orange-tauny and black, for the body, and the brown of the Mallards feather for the wings. If you do after my directions, they will kill fiſh, obſerving the times fitting, and follow my former Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
                  <p>If any worthy or honeſt Angler cannot hit of theſe my Directions, let him come to me, he ſhall read and I will work, he ſhall ſee all things done according to my foreſaid Directions: So I conclude for the Flie, having ſhewed you my true Experiments, with the Rod, I will ſet all labouring ſports aſide:</p>
                  <p>And now I am waiting on my Lord with a great Diſh of Trouts, who meeting with company, commanded me to turne Scullion, and dreſſe a Dinner of the Trouts wee had taken: whereupon I gave my Lord this Bill of fare, which I did furniſh his Table with, according as it was furniſhed with fleſh. Trouts in broth, which is reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: Trouts broyled, cut and filled with ſweet Herbes chopt: Trouts calvored hot with Antchovaes ſauce: Trouts boyled; out of which Kettle I make three Diſhes; the one for a Souſed Diſh, another for a Stew'd Diſh, the third for a hot Diſh: the Sauce is Butter, Vinegar, beaten Cinamon, with the juyce of a Lemmon, beaten very well together, that the Sauce is white and thick, or elſe it is no Sauce for a great mans Table: Trouts fryed, which muſt be done, and not put into the Pan, untill the Suet boyle very high, and kept with ſtirring all the time
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118810:113"/> they are frying, being flowr'd firſt. Trouts ſtew'd: Trouts cloſe, boyled with the calvored Trouts, all in one Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and the ſame liquor: Trouts butter'd with Egs: Trouts roaſted: Trouts baked: theſe are for the firſt courſe, before the Salt.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are for the latter courſe. Trouts calvored cold: Trouts flat cold: Baked Trouts: Trouts maril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that will eat perfect and ſweet three moneths in the heat of Summer: if I did ſay, for the whole year about, I would make it good.</p>
                  <p>For the dreſſing of four or five of the Diſhes, I will ſhew you how I did perform them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I will ſhew you for the boyling and calvoring, that ſerves for hot and cold, for firſt and latter courſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, you muſt draw out the Intrails of the fiſh, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the fiſh two or three times in the back; lay them in a Tray or Platter, put ſome Vinegar upon them; you ſhall ſee the fiſh turn ſanguine, if they be new, preſently: you muſt put ſo much water in the Kettle as you thinke will cover them, with a pint of Vinegar, a handfull of Salt, ſome Roſemary and Thyme and ſweet Marjoram tyed in a bunch: then you muſt make this liquor boyle with a fierce fire made of wood: when the liquor hath boyled very well, put in your fiſh by one and one, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your liquor alwayes boyling, untill you have put all in: having provided a cover for your Kettle, ſo put on the cover: you muſt have a paire of Bellowes to blow up the fire with ſpeed, that the liquor may boyle up to the top of the Kettle; ſo the fierce boiling will make the Fiſh to calvor: provided, the fiſh be new killed: you may let them boile nigh a quarter of an hour; when they are cold, you may put them in a Tray or earthen Pan, untill you have occaſion to uſe them: be ſure they lie covered.</p>

                  <p>For your ſtewed Trouts, you muſt cut them on the ſide, as for broiling: there are divers wayes of ſtewing; the Engliſh hath one way, the French hath another way, the Italian hath another way: I may ſpeak this; for I have been admitted into the Kitchins, to furniſh men of moſt Nations, when they have been in England.</p>
                  <p>We will begin with the Engliſh: He broyleth firſt upon a Charcoale fire: the firſt thing that you muſt have a care of is, when your Grid-iron is hot you muſt coole it with ruff Suet, then the skin of your Fiſh will not break, with care of turning them: when they are nigh broyled, take them off the Grid-iron; ſet on a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing-dish of coals in a Stew-pan, or Dish; put in a good quantity of fresh Butter, ſo much Vinegar as will give the relish, a penny-worth of beaten Cinamon; then put in your broyled fish, and let them ſtew, about halfe an houre will be ſufficient, being turned: adorn your Dish with Sippets, take the fish out of the ſtew-pan, lay them for the ſervice, be ſure to ſqueaſe a Lemmon on them: I will warrant them good victuall.</p>
                  <p>The Italian he ſtewes upon a Chafing-dish of coals, with white-Wine, Cloves, and Mace, Nutmegs ſliced, a little Ginger: you muſt underſtand when this fish is ſtewed, the ſame liquor that the fish is ſtewed in, muſt be beaten with ſome Butter and the juyce of a Lemmon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is dish'd for the ſervice. The French doe add to this a ſlice or two of Bacon.</p>
                  <p>I will ſhew you the way to marrionate a Trout or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fish, that will keep a quarter of a yeare in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which is the Italians rareſt Dish for fresh fish, and will eat perfect and ſweet.</p>
                  <p>You muſt take out the Intrailes as you doe of other fish, and cut them a-croſſe the ſides, as you do to broyle, washed clean, dried with a cloth, lay themupon a Tray
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118810:114"/> or board, ſprinkle a little ſalt on them, and flowre them as to frie them, ſo take your Frying-pan with ſo much Suet, when it is melted, as the Fiſh may lye to the mid-ſide in the liquor, and ſo fry them; and every time you turn them, flower them againe, untill you finde the fiſh fryed ſufficient: when you think the fiſh is fryed, take it out of the Pan, and lay it upon ſome thing, that the liquor may draine out of it; when the fiſh is cold, you may reare it an end.</p>
                  <p>You muſt have a cloſe Veſſell to keep this fiſh and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor in, that no winde comes in, according to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity you make triall of.</p>
                  <p>For the Liquor. Firſt, you muſt take halfe Claret-Wine, the other halfe Vinegar, two or three Bay-leaves, ſo much Saffron as a Nut tyed in a cloth, with ſome Cloves and large Mace, ſome Nutmeg ſliced; boile all theſe together very well; when the liquor is cold, and the fiſh cold, put the fiſh and liquor into the cloſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, with three or four Lemmons ſliced among the fish; make all cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſe that no winde can get into the Veſſell; after eight or ten days you may begin to eat of this fish; the Sauce muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <div type="recipe">
                     <head>To dreſſe a Pike.</head>
                     <p>When the <hi>Pike</hi> cometh into the Kitchin, kill it; then take a handfull of Salt, with water, and rub the fish ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well to take the ſlime off, draw out the Intrailes; wash the <hi>Pike</hi> cleane, put a handfull of <hi>Salt</hi> in the Pikes Belly; then take ſo much water, with a pinte of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar: if the <hi>Pike</hi> be any thing large, you muſt put in at leaſt three handfull of Salt, with a bunch of Roſemary, Thyme, and ſweet Marjoram, and two or three green
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118810:114"/> Onyons; boyle your liquor very well with a high fire made of wood; then put in your <hi>Pike,</hi> cover your Kettle, with your Bellows keep your Kettle boiling verie high for the ſpace of halfe an houre or thereabouts: a <hi>Pike</hi> asketh great boiling: for the Sauce, it is ſweet Butter well beaten with ſome of the top of the ſame liquor, with two or three Antchovaes, the skin taken off, and the bones taken out, a little Vinegar, ſo garnish your Dish: when your <hi>Pike</hi> is Dished, take the juyce of a Lemmon and put on the top of the fish: there is no doubt but it is good victuall.</p>
                     <p>I could ſet downe as many wayes to dreſs Eeles, as would furniſh a Lords Table: but I will relate but one.</p>
                     <p>Take off the skinne whole, till you come within two inches of the taile, beginning at the head: take out the Intrailes, waſh the Eele cleane, drie it with a cloth, ſcotch it all along both the ſides; take ſome Pepper and Salt, mixe them together, rub the Eele well with the Pepper, and Salt; draw the skinne on againe whole; tye the skinne about the head with a little thred lapped round, broyled on a Charcoale fire, let your Grid-iron be hot, rub your Grid iron with ſome ruffe Suet; the skinne will not burne; this is good; but take the skin off, and ſtew the Eele betwixt two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, on a Chafing-diſh of Coals, with ſweet Butter, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, and beaten Cinnamon, they will be better.</p>
                     <p>The boyling of a Carp is the very ſame way as I have ſhewed for the Trout, the ſcales on: no better Sauce can be made then the Antchovaes Sauce. The high boyling is the way for all freſh-water Fish: I have ſerved ſeven times ſeven years, to ſee the experiment.</p>
                     <p>If there be any Gentleman that liveth adjoyning to a River ſide, where Trouts are; I will ſhew the way to bring them to feed, that he may ſee them at his pleaſure;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118810:115"/> and to bring ſtore to the place. Gather great Garden-Wormes, the quantity of a pinte, or a quart, chop them in pieces, and throw them where you intend to have your pleaſure; with feeding often, there is no doubt of their comming; they will come as Sheep to the Pen: you muſt begin to feed with peeces of worms, by hand, by one and one, untill you ſee them eat; then you may feed with Liver or Lights, ſo your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire will be effected. And thus I conclude this ſhort Treatiſe.</p>
